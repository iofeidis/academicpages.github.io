### About Me

Welcome to my personal website! I'm Iason (/iason/) Ofeidis, a second-year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Yale University. Before joining the Ph.D. program, I was a Research Engineer at the [Yale Institute for Network Science (YINS)](https://yins.yale.edu/). My advisor is Prof. [Leandros Tassiulas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9qtgcZ8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I'm broadly interested in the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and networks, exploring how the former can enhance the efficiency and robustness of the latter. My current research focuses on network pruning and splitting for efficiency at the edge, as well as the comparison of data loading systems for Deep Learning. Specifically, I'm currently investigating Split Federated Learning with multi-modality, incorporating large language models (LLMs) to address diverse communication and computation constraints, focusing on system efficiency and performance. Additionally, my prior work involves applying data science to analyze the effects of US Monetary Policy on Decentralized Finance (DeFi).


I completed my undergraduate studies at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTh) in Greece, earning an M.Eng. in Electrical and Computer Engineering with specializations in Telecommunications. My diploma thesis focused on how Machine Learning can predict the emotional state of smartphone users by utilizing only their keystroke characteristics, and my advisor was Prof. [Leontios Hadjileontiadis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=OfAkcXkAAAAJ). Prior to joining Yale, I worked as a Research Assistant at the Institute of Applied Biosciences (INAB) at the Centre for Research and Technology (CERTH) in Greece. There, I led the software engineering operations, restructuring data processing, and integrating it into libraries for distribution among bioinformaticians.
